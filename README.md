## Overview of Authentication Process

- **Registration**: Users can create a new account by filling out the registration form in `register.html`. Upon submission, the data will be validated and processed.
- **Login**: Existing users can log in using their credentials in `login.html`. The application will verify the credentials and grant access if they are correct.
- **Styling**: The project uses `main.css` for styling the HTML pages to ensure a user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript Logic**: The `auth.js` file contains all necessary functions for form validation and handling user authentication processes.
